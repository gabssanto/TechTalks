# AI Pair Programming

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool that empowers developers to enhance their skills and capabilities. With its wide range of possibilities and applications, AI revolutionizes the way we approach development tasks, unlocking new opportunities for innovation. Although the fast pace of AI progress may render this article outdated soon, it serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the current state of AI and its potential to enhance the developer experience.

AI pair programming combines the expertise of human developers with the capabilities of AI models like Chat GPT, enabling a collaborative and synergistic coding experience. By working together, human developers and AI can tackle complex programming challenges more efficiently, improving code quality, productivity, and learning opportunities. This article explores the benefits of AI pair programming and its potential to transform the future of software development by examining scenarios and some examples I have experienced on day to day work, in Backend and Frontend development.

## Code Analysis

### React Bug Hunt Example

To illustrate the benefits of AI pair programming, let's examine a bug in a React application and demonstrate how AI can quickly resolve it. In this scenario, the bug is caused by a missing dependency array in the `useEffect` hook, resulting in a component being stuck in a loop. While experienced developers may easily identify and rectify such issues, it serves as a practical example of how AI pair programming can expedite bug-solving. It's worth noting that even seasoned developers commonly make small mistakes like this.

Consider the following React code snippet:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/gabssanto');
        const data = await response.json();
        setUserData(data);
        setCounter(counter + 1)
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    const interval = setInterval(fetchData, 500); // Fetch data every 0.5 seconds

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }); // No dependency array (infinite loop)

  if (!userData) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userData.login}</h1>
      <img src={userData.avatar_url} alt={userData.login} width="200" />
      <p>Followers: {userData.followers}</p>
      <p>Public Repositories: {userData.public_repos}</p>
      Re-renders: {counter}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this code, the `useEffect` hook lacks a dependency array, causing the effect to be invoked on every render, resulting in an infinite loop. An AI-powered pair programming tool can quickly identify this issue and suggest adding the missing dependency array, enabling the developer to resolve the bug efficiently.

## Learning Curve Reduction

AI can significantly reduce the learning curve associated with new technologies. When learning a new framework, for instance, AI can assist with syntax and code structure. This approach offers a valuable way to acquire knowledge by enabling developers to focus on concepts and logic rather than worrying about intricate details like syntax and structure.

To provide a personal example, I recently worked on a project that utilized an older version (4.x.x) of Ruby on Rails (RoR), which differed significantly from the current version. To quickly learn RoR 4.x.x, I leveraged AI to assist me with understanding the syntax and code structure. This approach allowed me to concentrate on grasping the concepts and logic behind the code, ultimately expediting my learning process.

Another example is the integration of Github Copilot with my current code editor, Visual Studio Code, which assists me in finding and using regular expressions (regex) effectively. By utilizing AI, I can focus on the logic behind the regex rather than being burdened by syntax and structure concerns.

In this context, AI refers to tools like Chat GPT and Bing Chat, which facilitate understanding language syntax and framework conventions. These tools expedited my ability to learn syntax and conventions, ultimately improving the code I could deliver for the project.

## Code Generation

Another valuable application of AI is code generation. Tools like Github's Copilot X can generate code snippets, such as RSpec tests for a Ruby on Rails controller. This approach accelerates the development process by providing a foundation of code that developers can refine and specify for each scenario. It serves as an excellent starting point, enabling faster progress while leaving room for individual fine-tuning.

## Competitive Advantage

As AI continues to advance, leveraging its power to enhance developers' productivity will become a competitive advantage. The ability to effectively utilize AI tools will differentiate developers in the future, enabling them to deliver more value to their organizations. Similar to the significance of knowing how to search proficiently on Google today, AI expertise will be a skill that significantly impacts day-to-day work. Mastering AI applications will empower developers to excel and stand out in their roles.

By embracing AI pair programming and leveraging the capabilities of AI models like Chat GPT, developers can improve their efficiency, productivity, and learning experience. The collaboration between human developers and AI opens up exciting possibilities for the future of software development.
